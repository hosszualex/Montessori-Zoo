# Montessori Zoo
As part of my university’s summer practice program, participated in VSP’s summer program to learn and develop my Android skills. The program simulated a working environment by assigning a project to me which I would author, supervised by a mentor. The application is called Montessori Zoo. Its role was to teach children, mainly toddlers, animals in the Montessori way.
Key Features and Concepts Learned:

• **Activity Lifecycle Behavioure** - Learned and practiced appropriate activity lifecycle behaviour.

• **ModelViewViewModel** - Architecture stuadied and applied to the project.

• **Display a lit of animals** - Advised to use RecyclerView in order to be able to display a list of animals. Using different ViewHolders,the
app also had the ability to change to different layout types. (List, Card and Grid)

• **Firebase** - Used Firebase in order to fufill 2 services the app needed. Realtimedatabase in order to store the data and fetch it. Authentication to be responsible for the security and profile part of the app.
