As part of my university’s summer practice program, participated in VSP’s summer program to learn and develop my Android skills. The program simulated a working environment by assigning a project to me which I would author, supervised by a mentor. The application is called Montessori Zoo. Its role was to teach children, mainly todlers, animals in the Montessori way.
Key Features and Concepts Learned:

• ModelViewViewModel - Architecture studied and applied to the project.

• Listofanimals - Advised to use RecyclerView in order to be able to display a list of animals. Using different ViewHolders,the
app also had the ability to change to different layout types. (List, Card and Grid)

• Firebase - Used Firebase in order to fufill 2 services the app needed. Realtimedatabase in order to store the data.
Authentication to be responsible for the security and profile part of the app.
