As part of my university’s summer practice program, participated in VSP’s summer program to learn and develop my Android skills. The program simulated a working environment by assigning a project to me which I would author, supervised by a mentor. The application is called Montessori Zoo. Its role was to teach children, mainly todlers, animals in the Montessori way.
